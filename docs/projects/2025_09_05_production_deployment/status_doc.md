# Production Deployment - Status Document

**Project Start:** September 5, 2025  
**Phase:** 6 of 6 (Future Phase - After Enhanced Notes Complete)  
**Goal:** Deploy research app to custom domain with production infrastructure

## Objective

Deploy the By Tomorrow research app to production with:

- Custom domain hosting for anywhere access
- Hosted PostgreSQL database (replacing local Docker)
- Cloud file storage for embedded images
- Basic authentication system
- Automated backup strategy
- Production-grade error handling and monitoring

## Current Deployment Readiness Assessment

### âœ… Already deployment-ready:
- **SvelteKit framework**: Built for production with adapters
- **PostgreSQL database**: Works great in hosted environments
- **Static assets**: Properly organized and optimized
- **Environment variables**: `.env` pattern established
- **Core functionality**: Search, library management, PDF viewer working

### ðŸ”¨ Changes needed for production:

**Minimal changes (1-2 hours):**
1. **Database migration**: Local PostgreSQL â†’ hosted (Supabase/Railway)
2. **Environment config**: Production `.env` with real database URLs
3. **Build adapter**: Configure for chosen hosting platform

**Additional features needed (2-4 hours total):**
1. **File upload system**: For image embedding in notes
2. **Authentication**: User login/registration (login route exists but no auth system)
3. **Error boundaries**: Production error handling
4. **Backup strategy**: Automated data export/backup

## Recommended Tech Stack

**Easy deployment path (2-4 hours total):**
- **Hosting**: Vercel (seamless SvelteKit deployment)
- **Database**: Supabase (managed PostgreSQL + auth + file storage)
- **Domain**: Custom domain via Vercel
- **Monitoring**: Built-in Vercel analytics

**Alternative options:**
- Netlify + Railway (similar ease)
- DigitalOcean App Platform (more configuration)
- Self-hosted VPS with Docker (most involved)

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 6A: Basic Deployment
1. Set up Supabase project with PostgreSQL database
2. Configure Vercel deployment with custom domain
3. Migrate schema and any existing data
4. Update environment variables for production

### Phase 6B: Production Features  
1. Implement file upload/storage via Supabase Storage
2. Add Supabase Auth for user authentication
3. Set up automated database backups
4. Configure error monitoring and logging

### Phase 6C: Polish & Monitoring
1. Add production error boundaries
2. Implement usage analytics
3. Set up uptime monitoring
4. Create deployment documentation

## Success Criteria

By completion, user should be able to:
- Access research app from any device via custom domain
- Upload and embed images in notes without local file system
- Log in securely and maintain personal research data
- Never lose data due to robust backup systems
- Trust system reliability for daily research workflow

## Dependencies

**Must complete first:**
- Enhanced note-taking system (Phase 1) - need working notes before deployment
- Basic image embedding functionality - critical for research workflow

**Nice to have:**
- Export functionality (Phase 2) - provides additional data safety
- Project organization (Phase 2) - better UX for multi-project research

## Current Status

**Status:** Not Started (Waiting for Phase 1 completion)  
**Estimated effort:** 2-4 hours for basic deployment, 1-2 additional days for production polish  
**Next milestone:** Complete enhanced note-taking system first
