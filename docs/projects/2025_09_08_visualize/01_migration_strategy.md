# Migration Strategy: SvelteKit to Python Backend

## Strategic Migration Approach

**Philosophy**: Incremental, value-driven migration that introduces Python for new capabilities first, then systematically consolidates research processing logic.

**Risk Mitigation**: Each phase delivers independent value and can operate alongside existing SvelteKit functionality.

## Phase 1: Visualization Foundation (4-6 weeks)

### Strategic Objective
Establish Python FastAPI service for visualization data processing while maintaining full compatibility with existing SvelteKit architecture.

### Scope
**New Components**:
- Python FastAPI service (`python-backend/`)
- Basic visualization API endpoints
- LayerChart integration in SvelteKit frontend
- PostgreSQL visualization cache tables

**Implementation Tasks**:
- Set up Python FastAPI project structure
- Create `/api/visualize/*` proxy endpoints in SvelteKit
- Implement basic data processing endpoints in Python
- Add LayerChart to SvelteKit frontend with sample visualizations
- Create visualization cache tables in shared PostgreSQL

**Success Criteria**:
- Python service runs independently and responds to API calls
- SvelteKit can proxy requests to Python service seamlessly
- LayerChart renders basic visualizations from Python-processed data
- Caching reduces visualization response times below 2 seconds

**Deliverables**:
- `python-backend/` directory with FastAPI app
- `src/routes/api/visualize/` proxy endpoints
- Updated frontend with LayerChart integration
- Database migration adding visualization tables

### Quality Gates
- All existing functionality remains unchanged
- Python service has comprehensive test coverage
- API documentation complete for visualization endpoints
- Performance benchmarks established for data processing

## Phase 2: PDF Processing Pipeline (6-8 weeks)

### Strategic Objective
Move PDF content extraction and processing to Python, establishing the research processing pipeline foundation.

### Scope  
**New Components**:
- PDF processing service in Python backend
- Asynchronous job queue for document processing
- Enhanced database schema for processed content
- Background processing UI in SvelteKit frontend

**Migration Components**:
- PDF upload handling (move from SvelteKit to Python)
- Content extraction and parsing logic
- Research data storage and indexing

**Implementation Tasks**:
- Implement PDF processing endpoints in Python FastAPI
- Set up async job queue (Celery or equivalent)
- Create processed content database tables
- Build processing status UI components
- Migrate PDF-related SvelteKit functionality to use Python endpoints

**Success Criteria**:
- PDFs processed and content extracted automatically
- Processing jobs run in background with progress tracking
- Extracted content searchable and linkable to existing metadata
- Processing pipeline handles multiple document types

### Risk Mitigation
- Phase runs parallel to existing PDF handling initially
- Gradual cutover once Python processing proves stable
- Rollback plan maintains SvelteKit PDF functionality

## Phase 3: Research Data Management (8-10 weeks)

### Strategic Objective
Consolidate core research entity management (papers, questions, claims, topics) in Python to enable advanced processing and ML features.

### Scope
**Migration Components**:
- Paper metadata CRUD operations
- Research entity linking and relationship management
- Tag and categorization systems
- Search and filtering capabilities

**Enhancement Components**:
- ML-driven research insights
- Advanced content analysis
- Automated paper categorization and linking
- Research pattern detection

**Implementation Tasks**:
- Port Prisma schema to SQLAlchemy models
- Implement research entity APIs in Python FastAPI
- Create data migration scripts for existing content
- Build enhanced research processing features
- Update SvelteKit frontend to use new Python APIs

**Success Criteria**:
- All research data operations function identically to current system
- Enhanced ML features provide new research insights
- Data migration completes without loss or corruption
- Performance meets or exceeds current system

### Migration Strategy
- **Dual-write period**: Updates go to both SvelteKit and Python
- **Read cutover**: Frontend gradually switches to Python APIs
- **SvelteKit deprecation**: Remove old endpoints once stable

## Phase 4: Complete Backend Consolidation (4-6 weeks)

### Strategic Objective
Complete the transformation to Python-centric architecture, with SvelteKit as pure frontend + authentication proxy.

### Scope
**Final Components**:
- User authentication and session management in Python
- Complete removal of SvelteKit server-side research logic
- Performance optimization and scaling preparation
- Documentation and deployment streamlining

**Implementation Tasks**:
- Implement authentication system in Python FastAPI
- Remove all research-related SvelteKit server endpoints
- Optimize Python service for production deployment
- Create comprehensive deployment documentation
- Performance testing and scaling analysis

**Success Criteria**:
- Single Python service handles all research processing
- SvelteKit serves purely as frontend application
- Deployment complexity reduced (single backend service)
- System performance improved through unified architecture

---

## Implementation Guidelines

### Development Environment
**Parallel Development**:
- Python backend developed alongside existing SvelteKit
- Feature flags for gradual frontend cutover
- Comprehensive testing ensures feature parity

**Testing Strategy**:
- End-to-end tests cover complete user workflows
- API contract tests ensure SvelteKit/Python compatibility
- Performance tests validate migration improvements
- Data integrity tests during migration phases

### Rollback Procedures
**Phase 1-2**: Simple service shutdown, SvelteKit continues independently
**Phase 3**: Dual-write enables quick revert to SvelteKit APIs
**Phase 4**: Database backups and migration scripts enable full rollback

### Success Metrics
**Technical Metrics**:
- API response times (target: <2s for visualizations, <500ms for CRUD)
- System uptime and reliability
- Database query performance
- PDF processing throughput

**User Experience Metrics**:
- Feature functionality unchanged or improved
- New visualization capabilities actively used
- Research workflow efficiency gains measurable
- No regression in core application performance

### Risk Management
**Technical Risks**:
- Python service performance vs SvelteKit
- Data migration complexity and integrity
- Integration complexity between services
- Third-party library compatibility

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Proof-of-concept implementations before full development
- Comprehensive testing at each phase
- Gradual cutover with rollback capabilities
- Performance monitoring and optimization

**Timeline Flexibility**:
- Each phase can extend if quality gates not met
- Phases can run in parallel where dependencies allow
- Emergency rollback procedures documented and tested
