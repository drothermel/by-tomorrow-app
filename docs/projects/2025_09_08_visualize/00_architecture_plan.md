# Visualization & Research Processing Architecture Plan

## Strategic Objective

Transform By Tomorrow from a research paper management system into a **computational research platform** that processes, analyzes, and visualizes research data through a unified Python backend, while maintaining the excellent SvelteKit user experience.

## Problem Context

**Current State**: SvelteKit manages static paper metadata with basic CRUD operations
**Future Vision**: Active PDF processing, content analysis, ML-driven insights, and interactive seaborn-style visualizations
**Key Constraint**: Research processing capabilities fundamentally require Python's scientific ecosystem

**Architectural Implications**:
- Research processing (PDF parsing, NLP, ML) is becoming the core differentiator
- Visualization is just one aspect of a broader computational research pipeline
- Split-brain architecture (research logic in two languages) creates technical debt
- Python ecosystem is essential for advanced research features

## Requirements & Constraints

**Must-Haves**:
- LayerChart integration for seaborn-style faceted visualizations
- PDF processing and content extraction pipeline
- Shared PostgreSQL database for consistency
- Maintain existing SvelteKit user experience
- Research data caching for performance

**Integration Points**:
- Existing paper metadata and library management
- User authentication and session handling
- File upload and storage systems
- Real-time visualization updates

**Performance Constraints**:
- Visualization data must cache effectively
- PDF processing can be async/background
- Frontend remains responsive during heavy computation

## Decision Frameworks

### Architecture Pattern Choice
**Options**: Service-Oriented vs Full Migration vs Hybrid Evolution

**Decision Criteria**:
- **Long-term maintainability**: Single language for research logic preferred
- **Development velocity**: Incremental migration reduces risk
- **Feature completeness**: Python ecosystem requirements
- **Team expertise**: Leverage existing SvelteKit frontend skills

**Recommendation**: **Gradual Migration to Python Backend**
- Preserves SvelteKit frontend excellence
- Consolidates research processing in Python
- Enables systematic, low-risk transition

### Technology Stack Choices
**Frontend**: SvelteKit (pure client-side) + LayerChart
**Backend**: Python FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + Pydantic
**Database**: PostgreSQL (shared between phases)
**Processing**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib/seaborn for data prep
**PDF Pipeline**: PyMuPDF or pdfplumber for content extraction

### Error Handling Strategy
**Graceful Degradation**: Visualization failures don't break core app
**Caching Strategy**: Expensive computations cached with TTL
**Background Processing**: Long PDF processing jobs queued
**User Feedback**: Clear progress indicators for processing stages

## Success Criteria

**Functional Success**:
- Interactive seaborn-style visualizations render in LayerChart
- PDF content extraction and processing pipeline operational
- Research data queries perform under 2s with caching
- All existing paper management functionality preserved

**Architectural Success**:
- Research processing logic unified in Python
- Clear separation between frontend UX and backend processing
- Database schema supports both current and future research features
- Migration can proceed incrementally without feature disruption

**Quality Standards**:
- Follow existing By Tomorrow code conventions and patterns
- Comprehensive test coverage for new Python services
- API documentation for all visualization endpoints
- Performance monitoring for data processing pipeline

## Adaptation Guidance

**Discovery Scenarios**:
- **Python development slower than expected**: Fall back to service-oriented approach, maintain SvelteKit APIs longer
- **LayerChart integration challenges**: Consider alternative Svelte visualization libraries or custom D3 integration  
- **Performance bottlenecks in data processing**: Implement more aggressive caching, consider async processing patterns
- **Database schema evolution needed**: Use Prisma migrations for compatibility, SQLAlchemy migrations for new features

**Decision Points**:
- After Phase 1: Evaluate Python FastAPI development velocity vs SvelteKit
- After Phase 2: Assess PDF processing performance and consider scaling strategies
- Before Phase 3: Review data consistency patterns and choose migration approach

**Quality Gates**:
- Each phase must maintain or improve existing functionality
- No regression in user experience or performance
- Python service must demonstrate clear value over SvelteKit equivalent

## Documentation Requirements

**Technical Documentation**:
- API specifications for all Python endpoints
- Database schema evolution and migration guides
- Frontend integration patterns for LayerChart
- Performance benchmarking and optimization notes

**Process Documentation**:
- Phase-by-phase migration checklist
- Rollback procedures for each migration phase  
- Testing strategies for hybrid SvelteKit/Python architecture
- Development environment setup for Python backend

**Decision Record**:
- Architecture choice rationale and trade-offs
- Technology selection criteria and alternatives considered
- Migration timeline and risk mitigation strategies
- Lessons learned and recommendations for similar future projects
