# Week 1 Progress & Decision Log

## Strategic Progress Summary

**Major Accomplishment**: Successfully resolved all pre-Week 1 blocking questions and achieved significant foundational progress. Ready to execute deployment pipeline validation with high confidence.

**Key Breakthroughs**:
- ‚úÖ **Published core dependencies** (dr_plotter, datadec) to PyPI
- ‚úÖ **Domain secured** with optimal choice for target audience
- ‚úÖ **Data pipeline validated** with real ML experiment datasets
- ‚úÖ **Technology stack finalized** with proven integration patterns

## Critical Design Decisions & Justifications

### **Domain Selection: `bytomorrow.app`**

**Decision**: Chose `bytomorrow.app` over `bytmr.io`

**Options Considered**:
- `bytomorrow.app` - Full brand name, .app TLD
- `bytmr.io` - Abbreviated, tech-focused .io TLD

**Justification**:
- **Target audience alignment**: Academic/research users prefer clear, professional domains over abbreviated tech domains
- **Communication efficiency**: "bytomorrow.app" immediately clear in verbal sharing; "bytmr.io" requires explanation
- **Brand consistency**: Perfect match with "By Tomorrow" application name
- **Professional credibility**: Full words signal seriousness and attention to detail in research context
- **Future-proofing**: Strong brand recognition as platform grows

**Real-world impact**: Email sharing, conference presentations, and academic paper citations all benefit from clear domain recognition.

### **PyPI Publishing Strategy: Dependencies First**

**Decision**: Publish `dr_plotter` and `datadec` to PyPI before Week 1 deployment

**Original Question**: Skip PyPI publishing vs publish for cleaner deployment
**Resolution Path**:
1. Identified Git dependency in datadec (`dr-plotter @ git+https://...`)
2. Realized this blocks PyPI publishing of datadec
3. Published dr_plotter to PyPI first
4. Updated datadec to use published dependency
5. Published datadec to PyPI

**Justification**:
- **Deployment cleanliness**: Railway `pip install datadec` vs complex Git dependency handling
- **Version control**: Exact package versions vs floating Git commits
- **Professional development**: Established packages vs local directory dependencies
- **Future collaboration**: Easy sharing and installation for collaborators

**Process insights**:
- TestPyPI validation caught dependency resolution issues early
- uv toolchain worked seamlessly for publishing workflow
- Publishing process was faster than expected (15-30 minutes total)

### **Database Architecture: PostgreSQL from Day 1**

**Decision**: Include PostgreSQL in Week 1 vs start with in-memory data

**Justification** (based on past experience):
- **Eliminate double debugging**: Local vs remote database differences create significant overhead
- **Realistic performance testing**: Actual database queries vs artificial in-memory speed
- **Schema validation**: Database constraints and indexing behavior validated early
- **Deployment parity**: Production environment matches development from start

**Risk mitigation**: Start with minimal schema, expand incrementally

### **Visualization Scope: Line Charts for ML Scaling Analysis**

**Decision**: Focus on line charts showing ML experiment scaling results

**Justification**:
- **Immediate value**: Addresses real visualization need for datadec analysis
- **Technical validation**: Sufficient complexity to test full data pipeline
- **Natural fit**: ML scaling analysis is ideal line chart use case
- **Dataset availability**: datadec provides rich, real datasets vs artificial test data

**Implementation advantage**: datadec's pandas DataFrames convert easily to LayerChart JSON format

### **API Endpoint Structure: `/api/visualize/data`**

**Decision**: Generic endpoint with extensibility vs specific `/api/visualize/line`

**Justification**:
- **Future flexibility**: Leaves room for different chart types and data sources
- **Clean abstraction**: Separates API design from current implementation details  
- **RESTful patterns**: Standard endpoint naming conventions
- **Parameter extensibility**: Can add query parameters for chart type, filtering, etc.

### **Security Strategy: Obscure URL Path**

**Decision**: Use obscure URL path (`/coldbrewbubbletea/`) vs authentication system

**Justification for Week 1**:
- **Implementation speed**: Zero authentication complexity during deployment validation
- **Sufficient privacy**: Data visualization not highly sensitive, hard-to-guess URLs adequate
- **User experience**: No login friction for stakeholder demos and sharing
- **Incremental security**: Can add proper authentication in Week 2+ after deployment proven

**Limitation acknowledged**: Not real security, but appropriate for development phase

### **Deployment Sequence: Hybrid Approach**

**Decision**: Minimal deployment validation first, then local development

**Rejected alternatives**:
- **Local-first**: High risk of late-stage deployment surprises
- **Deployment-first**: Slow iteration during complex visualization development

**Justification**:
- **Risk management**: Validate deployment pipeline early, develop features in fast local environment
- **Best of both worlds**: Deployment confidence + development velocity
- **Incremental complexity**: Add features to proven infrastructure

## Strategic Position

**Pre-Week 1 Accomplishments** have significantly de-risked the deployment pipeline validation. The combination of:
- Proven technology integrations
- Published dependencies  
- Secured infrastructure
- Clear implementation path

...positions Week 1 for high-confidence execution focused on platform mechanics rather than fundamental technology decisions.

**Key Insight**: The thorough pre-work and decision resolution process has transformed Week 1 from "will this work?" to "how quickly can we make this work?" - a much stronger strategic position for the visualization platform development.
