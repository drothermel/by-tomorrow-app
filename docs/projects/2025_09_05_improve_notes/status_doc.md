# Enhanced Note-Taking System - Status Document

**Project Start:** September 5, 2025  
**Phase:** 1 of 5 (Current Focus)  
**Goal:** Build robust note-taking system for research workflow

## Objective

Extend the current Document model and interface to support structured research notes with:

- Automatic metadata generation (date, project, tags)
- Rich text formatting and editing
- Image embedding for experimental results
- Version history to prevent data loss
- Cross-referencing to papers and other notes

## Success Criteria

By completion, user should be able to:
- Create experiment notes with auto-populated metadata
- Embed images of results directly in notes
- Reference papers seamlessly from notes
- Track note versions and never lose work
- Export all data for backup

## Current Status

**Status:** Planning & Analysis  
**Next Steps:** Examine existing Document model and plan schema extensions

## Implementation Plan

1. **Database Schema Updates** - Extend Document model for metadata, versioning, images
2. **Rich Text Editor** - Implement formatting capabilities  
3. **Auto-Metadata System** - Date, project, tag automation
4. **Image Upload/Embed** - File handling and display
5. **Version Control** - Track changes and history
6. **Cross-Reference UI** - Easy linking to papers/notes
