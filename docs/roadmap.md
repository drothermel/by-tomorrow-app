# Roadmap

The project is still evolving. The short term focus is on improving paper management and iterating on the editor. Longer term goals aim to make By Tomorrow a full research workflow companion.

## Near term

- Polish the arXiv search interface and add filters.
- Extend the library view with pagination and per-paper actions.
- Add authentication and user accounts.
- Expand the Svedit editor with drag–and–drop reordering.

## Future ideas

- Integrate local file uploads and annotate PDFs directly in the reader mode.
- Collaborative editing and shared libraries.
- Richer tagging and querying across documents and notes.
